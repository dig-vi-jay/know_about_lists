		<h2 align="center">DESCRIPTION LIST</h2>
		<p style="font-family:sans-serif;margin-left:20px">HTML Description List or Definition List displays elements in definition form like in dictionary. The dl,dt and dd tags are used to define description list.A description list is a list of items with a description or definition of each item.The description list is created using dl element. The dl element is used in conjunction with the dt element which specify a term, and the dd element which specify the term's definition.It is generally used to mention different things and giving information about each of them in detailed way.</p>

		<dt style="font-family:sans-serif">Igneous Rocks</dt>
		<dd>Igneous rocks (from the Greek word for fire) form when hot, molten rock crystallizes and solidifies. The melt originates deep within the Earth near active plate boundaries or hot spots, then rises toward the surface. Igneous rocks are divided into two groups, intrusive or extrusive, depending upon where the molten rock solidifies. Examples of intrusive igneous rocks are diorite, gabbro, granite, pegmatite, and peridotite. Examples of intrusive igneous rocks are diorite, gabbro, granite, pegmatite, and peridotite.Examples of extrusive igneous rocks are andesite, basalt, dacite, obsidian, pumice, rhyolite, scoria, and tuff.</dd>
		<dt style="font-family:sans-serif">sedimentary Rocks</dt>
		<dd>Sedimentary rocks are types of rock that are formed by the accumulation or deposition of small particles and subsequent cementation of mineral or organic particles on the floor of oceans or other bodies of water at the Earth's surface.Clastic sedimentary rocks such as breccia, conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone, and shale are formed from mechanical weathering debris.Chemical sedimentary rocks, such as rock salt, iron ore, chert, flint, some dolomites.Organic sedimentary rocks such as coal, some dolomites, and some limestones.</dd>
		<dt style="font-family:sans-serif">Metamorphic Rocks</dt>
		<dd>Metamorphic rocks started out as some other type of rock, but have been substantially changed from their original igneous, sedimentary, or earlier metamorphic form. Metamorphic rocks form when rocks are subjected to high heat, high pressure, hot mineral-rich fluids etc.There are two basic types of metamorphic rocks. Foliated metamorphic rocks such as gneiss, phyllite, schist, and slate have a layered or banded appearance that is produced by exposure to heat and directed pressure.Non-foliated metamorphic rocks such as hornfels, marble, quartzite, and novaculite don't have a layered or banded appearance.</dd>
